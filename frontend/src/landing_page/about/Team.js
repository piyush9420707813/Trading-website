           Hi, I'm Piyush Sanjay Gawali, an enthusiastic and self-driven Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student at AISSM's Institute of Information Technology, Pune (Batch of 2027). My passion lies at the intersection of technology, innovation, and real-world problem-solving, which has led me to explore fields like Web Development, AI/ML, and Data Structures & Algorithms.

Iâ€™ve built impactful projects such as:

ðŸ§  An AI-Based Forgery Detection System using YOLOv4 and OCR for fast, accurate verification of documents.

ðŸŒ¾ A smart agriculture platform "Smart Krushi" that won 1st prize at Techathon 2.0, combining AI chatbot support, government scheme recommendations, and multilingual access for farmers.

With a strong academic foundation (current CGPA: 8.9) and hands-on experience in both hardware and software projects, Iâ€™m constantly upskilling through certifications, internships, and hackathons.

Outside the tech world, I enjoy playing the tabla, reading books that offer life lessons, and playing cricket to refresh my mind.

Iâ€™m currently looking to collaborate, learn, and contribute to exciting projects and internships in the field of software development and AI applications. Letâ€™s build something meaningful together!
